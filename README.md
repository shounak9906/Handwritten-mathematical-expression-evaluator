# Handwritten-mathematical-expression-evaluator
This program can recognize digits 0-9 and can evaluate expressions containing '+', '-', '/' and '*' symbols. 
The program cannot recognize the traditional multiplication and division symbols but only the '/' and '*' symbols. 
It is a part of my Extended Qualification project and uses Numpy, CV2, matplotlib, eras and tensor flow among other libraries

The dataset used to train the model can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clarencezhao/handwritten-math-symbol-dataset
